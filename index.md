### Welcome to Tarasenka Alexander site!

## Some words about me
I'm a student of a Belarusian State University, the 2nd grade. My faculty is named as "The faculty of applied math and mechanics", my speciality is "Applied Informatics" and I am proud of my place in the life. 
I have some experience in solo programming (like barley-break in windows forms, for example) and in programming with my groupmates (our own small game).
Among my strong traits I can't don't mention my great intelligence, perseverance, calm and modesty.
I'm really inspired by the fact that I can become part of such giant company and I suppose it will become true as soon as it possible.

## My interests
What concerns my hobbies, first of all it is reading. I prefer to read a lot about everything: about self-developing, about future and past, about politics and usual life and so on. For me books is a bottomless source of knowledge.
Also I have some experience in programming in neural networks. Our team even participated in the hackathon "What the HACK?!" and it was really intresting thing.
At last, I'm a member of the debates club of my university, and I can say that this new sphere of my life is enough fascinating and useful.
